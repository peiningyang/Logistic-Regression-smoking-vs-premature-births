# Logistic Regression: Mother's Smoking Behavior vs. Premature Births

Previous research has shown that pregnant mothers who smoke cigarettes can lead to many health issues in their babies. In this assignment, we will examine whether a mother’s smoking behavior is correlated with pre-term births, which are infants born with a gestational age of less than 270 days. If we do detect a relationship, we will look for the odds ratio of pre-term births for smokers and non-smokers. On top of that, we will also investigate whether the odds ratio is influenced by the mother’s race. Lastly, we will also explore other variables associated with the mother and determine whether there are any significant associations to pre-term births.
